# HireHub Job Portal

## Overview
HireHub is a simple **job portal application** built with **Python and Flask**. It provides users with a platform to **view available jobs, apply for positions**, and allows admins to **manage job listings** efficiently. This project helped me understand the basics of web development, working with templates, routing, forms, sessions, and integrating CI/CD freestyle projects using Jenkins for deployment.

# HireHub Job Portal

## Overview
HireHub is a **simple job portal application** built using **Python and Flask** as a **10-day learning project**. It allows users to **browse jobs, apply for positions, manage profiles**, and enables admins to **handle job listings and view applications**. This project helped me gain hands-on experience with Flask, web routing, templates, sessions, forms, and basic CI/CD deployment.

## Features
- **Home page:** Displays a welcome message and recent job listings.  
- **Jobs page:** Lists all available jobs with details like title, location, salary, and experience.  
- **Apply page:** Users can submit applications for selected jobs.  
- **Profile page:** Users can view and update their personal information.  
- **Upload Resume:** Users can upload their resume for applications.  
- **Admin Panel:** Admins can add, edit, and delete job listings.  
- **View Applications:** Admins can see all applications submitted by users.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Snehaloges/HireHub_JobPortal.git
   cd HireHub_JobPortal

## Installation
Follow these steps to run the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:  

   git clone https://github.com/Snehaloges/HireHub_JobPortal.git
   cd HireHub_JobPortal

2.**Create a virtual environment:**

    python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

3.**Windows**:

   venv\Scripts\activate


 **Linux/Mac**:

   source venv/bin/activate


## Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Running the App

**Start the Flask server:**

python app.py


**Open your browser and go to:**

http://127.0.0.1:5000

## Manual Testing:
Written a testcases and verify  the test case passes

## Postman Testing

- Test API endpoints like login, register, apply job, and fetch job listings using Postman.

- Verify request and response data to ensure correct functionality of backend routes.

## Jenkins (simplest Deployment)

-Project includes basic CI/CD setup using Jenkins for automated deployment.  
-Jenkins pulls the latest code from GitHub, installs dependencies, and runs the Flask app automatically.  
-It helped me understand the workflow of continuous integration and deployment for a web application.
